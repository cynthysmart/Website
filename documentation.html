        <p>Abstract:-This study was carried out to investigate the influence of students’ self-concept on their academic achievement in
  secondary school mathematics. The researchers employed descriptive survey research design. Two (2) research questions
  and two (2) hypotheses guided the study. The population of the study comprised of two thousand, four hundred and one (2401)
  SS2 students from the thirty-one (31) secondary schools in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State. A sample of one hundred and fifty (150) students from five (5) schools were
  selected through random sampling techniques. The instrument
  for data collection was Students’ Self-Concept Questionnaire(SSQ) structured on a four point Likert scale. The instrument
  was validated by three (3) experts from University of Nigeria
  Nsukka. Cronbach Alpha formular was used to ascertain the
  internal consistency of the questionnaire and a reliability
  coefficient of 0.908 was obtained. Mean and standard deviations
  were used to answer the research questions while chi-square (χ 2
  )
  and t-test were used to test the null hypothesis 1 and 2
  respectively at 0.05 level of significance. The findings of the study
  revealed that the students’ self-concept influences their academic
  achievement in mathematics with overall mean of 2.6273 and it is
  statistically significant. Also, students’ gender does not influence
  their academic achievement in mathematics with overall mean of
  2.2660 which isn’t statistically significant. Based on the findings
  of the study, it was recommended among others that classroom
  teachers should use some teaching strategies that would boost
  students’ academic self-concept which will in turn promote their
  academic achievement in mathematics.

    <header>Introduction</header>
    <article>
      <p>Mathematics is a subject that studies about numbers,
  arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry among
  others. Mathematics is studied in both primary and secondary
  schools as a compulsory subject. Mathematics like any other
  compulsory and examinable subject offered in both primary
  and secondary school level has a key role in shaping how
  individuals deal with various spheres of private, social and
  civil life. There is no existing field of study which does not
  require the use of mathematical theories or numerical
  computations in one way or the other. Ncube (2013) was of
  the view that mathematics is the bedrock and an indispensable
  tool for scientific, technological and economic advancement
  of any nation</p>
  <p>Mathematics is all around us, in everything we do. It
  is the building block for everything in our daily lives,
  including mobile devices, architecture (ancient and modern),
  art, money, engineering, and even sports (Elaine, 2013).
  Therefore, mathematics is a subject that education and human
  life cannot function effectively without it. The knowledge of
  mathematics is very useful and leads students to understand
  lessons in other subjects and thereby making them mentally
  alert. Mathematics knowledge indeed equips individuals with
  the skill to solve a wide range of practical tasks and problems
  they may encounter in life. Ojimba (2012) was of the view
  that without mathematics, there is no science, without science,
  there is no modern technology and without modern
  technology, there is no modern society.</p>
  <p>In Nigeria, mathematics has been made a compulsory
  subject in the elementary and higher school curricula since it
  is the key for industrial and technological development.
  Despite the importance placed on the subject, students’
  mathematics achievement has been relatively poor. This may
  be as result of many tropical issues such as mathematics
  phobia, students’ attitude, self-concept, teacher’s
  methodology, inadequate use of technology in teaching, lack
  of motivation. The poor achievement of students in
  mathematics in recent years may be likened to the complex
  nature of mathematics content. In spite of all the important
  roles mathematics plays in the development of mankind, its
  achievement has been poor and must be investigated by
  researchers (Agwagah, 2004).</p>
  <p>Academic achievement is the outcome of education which
  extends to what a student, teacher or institution has achieved
  in the educational goals. It is commonly measured by
  examinations or continuous assessment. Academic
  achievement refers to how well a student is accomplishing his
  or her tasks and studies. It is observed by Damrongpanit,
  Reungtragul and Pittayanon (2007) that in the present time,
  the students’ academic achievement is underlined to become a
  major direction in the national education, because academic
  Academic achievement is the outcome of education which
  extends to what a student, teacher or institution has achieved
  in the educational goals. It is commonly measured by
  examinations or continuous assessment. Academic achievement refers to how well a student is accomplishing his
  or her tasks and studies. It is observed by Damrongpanit,
  Reungtragul and Pittayanon (2007) that in the present time,
  the students’ academic achievement is underlined to become a
  major direction in the national education, because academic
  achievement of the students is the most suitable indicator to
  show the educational success. Thus, researchers are interested
  in finding the factors that affect academic achievement in
  mathematics not just because of the importance of
  mathematics but also because of the poor achievement in the
  subject. Research conducted by Marsh and Craven (2006) and
  Areepattamanni and Freeman (2008) showed a strong
  association among students’ motivation, self-concept and
  academic achievement. They also disclosed that many
  students have the perception and belief that mathematics is
  complex, abstract and very hard or difficult to understand.
  These negative perceptions of students towards mathematics
  have eaten deep into the minds of students in secondary school
  which in turn invariably may influence their academic
  achievement (Mohamed & Waheed, 2011).
  Self-concept is one’s perception image of one’s
  ability and uniqueness. Self-concept is a collection of beliefs
  about one’s own nature, unique qualities and typical
  behaviour, your self-concept is your mental picture of
  yourself. Balarabe and Bakari (2013) explained that selfconcept is multi-faceted, hieratical, organized and structured,
  descriptive and evaluative, stable and yet increasingly
  situation specific. Self-concept can be positive or negative.
  People with positive self concept have the ability to cope and
  deal with the problems facing them while people with negative
  self-concept lack that ability. Students’ ability may have influence on their
  academic achievement. Hence, students’ achievement may
  depend on their self-concept. That is, their achievement in
  mathematics may depend on what they thought of or believed
  about themselves with reference to mathematics as a subject.
  Students with positive self-concept and who value the
  importance of mathematics are more likely to attain a higher
  mathematics achievement than their peers with negative selfconcept. Students with a positive self-concept acquire more
  success in areas of social, scientific and occupation. Several
  studies have revealed an association between students’ selfconcept and academic achievement. Self-concept can be
  divided into two distinct factors, academic and non-academic
  self-concepts. Academic self-concept refers to an individual’s
  knowledge and perceptions about themselves in academic
  achievement situation while non-academic self-concept is
  about perception of oneself in non-academic activities which
  include their physical self and their relation with parents,
  friends and community (Catherine, 2013).</p>
  <p>The students’ self-concept on mathematics may
  differently influence their academic achievement according to
  gender. Gender is simply referred to as the biological, social &
  cultural sex of an individual either male or female. The gender
  of a person may go a long way in affecting how the person
  thinks, behaves and lives. Gender differences in secondary
  school are prominent issues that have the focus of many.
  From the foregoing one can insinuate that students’
  achievement in secondary school mathematics which is at a
  poor state might owe to both male and female students’ selfconcept in the subject among other variable associated factors.
  Hence there is need to determine the influence of male and
  female students’ self-concept on their secondary school
  mathematics achievement.</p>
  <p>The greatest failure in secondary school external
  examinations such as the one conducted by WAEC, NECO
  and NABTEB is recorded in mathematics. This problem has
  generated a great concern among the members of the society,
  stakeholders in education, mathematics educators, parents, and
  even the students. Although some other strategies and methods
  have been tried out by some researchers in different areas in
  mathematics, the poor achievement still persist. As a result of
  this, there is need to go an extra mile of understanding the
  learners themselves, their self-concept towards mathematics with the aim of suggesting strategies for improvement in the
  teaching and learning of the subject. The problem of this study
  therefore is to find out how students' self-concept influences
  their achievement in secondary school mathematics.
   The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence
  of self-concept on secondary school students’ academic
  achievement in mathematics. Specifically, the study sought to:
  Determine the influence of students’ self-concept on their
  achievement in mathematics and to investigate whether gender
  influences the students’ self-concept in mathematics. </p>

      <p>The researchers employed descriptive survey research design.
  A survey research is one in which a group of people or items
  is studied by collecting and analyzing data from only a few
  people or items considered to be representation of the entire
  group (Nworgu, 2015). Descriptive survey research design is
  appropriate in this study because the researchers are dealing
  with a large population and so needs questionnaire to collect
  data or information that will be used to answer the research
  questions and to test the hypotheses.</p>
  <p>The population of the study comprised of two thousand four
  hundred and one (2401) SS2 students from the thirty-one
  secondary schools in Nsukka Local Government Area of
  Enugu State in 2018/2019 session. The sample of this study
  consists of one hundred and fifty (150) SS2 students randomly
  selected from five (5) schools out of the thirty-one (31)
  secondary schools in Nsukka L.G.A. Simple random sampling
  was also used in selecting the five (5) schools. Instrument used
  for data collection was Students’ Self-concept Questionnaire
  (SSQ). The instrument was validated by three (3) experts. Two
  (2) from the department of Science Education and one (1)
  from department of Educational Foundation, all from
  University of Nigeria Nsukka.. The reliability of the
  instrument was ascertained using Cronbach Alpha which gave
  a reliability index of 0.908</p>
  <p>The data collected with the instrument was analyzed
  using mean and standard deviation to answer the research
  questions while chi-square (χ2
  ) and t-test were employed in
  testing the hypotheses 1 and 2 respectively at 0.05 level of
  significance. The level of acceptance of the criterion mean is
  2.50.</p>

    <header>Discussion of Findings</header>
    <article>
     <p>The result from Table I revealed that students' selfconcept has a significant influence on their mathematics
    achievement in secondary school. This means that the higher a
    student's self concept, the higher the achievement. This is in
    agreement with the findings of many researchers such as
    Areepattamanni and Freeman (2008), Naranjo (2007), Marsh
    and Craven, (2006), Lotfabadi (2004) that revealed from their
    various studies a clear positive relationship between selfconcept and academic achievement of students. However, the
    findings of this study showed a divergence from the findings
    of Jen & Chien (2008) who claims that academic self concept does not influence academic achievement but rather past
    achievement influences the formation of academic selfconcept.<//p>
    <p>The result of Table II revealed that gender does not
    influence students’ self-concept in mathematics. This means
    that being a male or female does not affect a student's selfconcept on mathematics. This finding is in line with the
    finding of Farooq and Shah (2008) who found from their
    different studies that there is no significant influence of gender
    on attitude towards and self- concept of students on
    mathematics. However the finding of this study disagrees with
    Andrea (2011), Tella & Tella (2005) who found that there is a
    significant influence of gender on self-concept of students in
    mathematics.</p>

    <article>
      <p>The study examined the influence of self-concept on
  secondary school students’ academic achievement in
  mathematics. The study revealed that the students’ selfconcept influences their academic achievement in secondary
  school mathematics. It also shows that gender does not
  significantly influence the students’ self-concept. The study
  concluded that students with positive or high self-concept will
  invariably have high achievement in mathematics. The
  converse is also true irrespective of gender.

    <header>Recommendations</header>
    <article>
      <p>Based on the findings of this study, the following
  recommendations were made:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Students should develop a high self-concept in
          themselves.</li>
          <li>Classroom teachers should use some teaching
          strategies that would boast students’ academic selfconcept will in turn promote academic achievement
          in mathematics.</li>
          <li>The curriculum designers and the teachers should
          articulate well on the usefulness and applicability of
          mathematics in general so that students create
          positive minds towards the subject and subsequently
          strive to achieve higher.</li>
          <li>Teachers, parents and the society at large should help
          both male and female students not to see mathematics
          as a unisex endeavor.</li>
          <li>Teachers should provide the male and female
          students the enabling environment to learn and solve
          mathematical problems cooperatively in order to
          maintain equity in mathematics achievement.</li>
